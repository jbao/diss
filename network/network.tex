\chapter{Network topology and dynamics}
\label{chap:network}

Cells initiate and control decisions like migration, proliferation or differentiation through the intricate, yet
coordinated, regulation of large gene interaction networks. 
As a consequence, there is  well orchestrated time-sequential regulation of protein pathways, resulting in and regulated by a  global change in gene expression.
Gaining insight into the necessary and suffient regulators controlling cellular decisions  is therefore difficult. 
The central questions are, how to bridge the large data set to a few regulator or key players, how does the cell come to unique and well defined decisions despite the underlying complexity?

Systems theory points to ways how complex systems are regulated and obey common rules with respect to their organisation and dynamic responses~\citep{Kauffman1993}. 
In order to tackle the complexity of such systems, 
one usually works with
an abstract
representation or a graph\footnote{Throughout the text, we use \emph{graph} and \emph{network} interchangably.} consisting of different molecules as nodes and the 
interactions among them as edges. In order to understand the
behavior of complex systems, one has to understand both
the topological and dynamical properties of networks. In this chapter, we first
introduce some graph theoretical concepts, we then investigate the dynamics and
topology in \emph{in silico} networks, finally we present a biological application.

\section{Complex networks in biology and beyond}
Biological phenomena are described in the context of a network
at all spatial and temporal scales, from food web~\citep{Williams2000}, 
neuronal network~\citep{White1986}, gene regulatory networks~%
\citep{Kauffman1969,Gama-Castro2008,Abdulrehman2011},
protein-protein interaction networks~\citep{Jeong2001,Stelzl2005}
to metabolic network~\citep{Herrgaard2008}.

The study of networks dates back to the K\"onigsberg
problem from Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. The initial
problem deals with seven bridges across the river in the city
of K\"onigsberg, and the aim is to find a walk through the 
city that would cross each bridge once and only once, to which
Euler proved that there is no solution. For a long time,
graph theory remains a specialized and abstract mathematical 
discipline. Not until the publication of the first 
small-world network model~\citep{Watts1998} did people
realize that there is a class of networks, which is neither
purely random nor purely regular and can represent most of
the real-world structures, ranging from Internet, power grid
to collaboration graph of film actors, and also biological
networks.

Study of biological networks has been largely inspired by the theoretical 
analyses of other types of networks~\citep{Barabasi2004}. In recent years, 
there is also increasing interest in the comparison between biological and
other networks. For instance, the transcriptional regulatory network of 
\emph{E. coli} is found to have a triangle-like hierarchical 
structure, whereas the Linux kernel displays rather an inverse-triangle
hierarchy, which again is due to different design principles of the two 
systems: robustness for biological systems and cost effectiveness for 
software systems~\citep{Yan2010}.
Such findings highlight the hypothesis of \emph{form follows function}, or 
the function of complex networks is reflected in their distinct structural 
properties.

\section{Network topology}
There are a variety of measures that characterize the topology of networks,
some capture local network topology, yet others are global topological measures.

\subsection{Topological measures}

\subsubsection{Degree and degree distribution}
The \emph{degree} (or connectivity) $k_i$ of a node $i$ is the number of edges 
connecting the node, in case of directed networks, one further distinguishes
between incoming ($k_i^{in}$) and outgoing degree ($k_i^{out}$). Then the total 
degree is defined as $k_i = k_i^{out} + k_i^{in}$. A list of the node degrees 
of a network is called the \emph{degree sequence}.

The \emph{degree distribution} $P(k)$, or the fraction of nodes in the graph 
$G$ having degree $k$, is probably the most basic topological 
characterization of a graph. It has been shown that the degree distribution of
a neuronal network determines its global oscillatory state~\citep{Roxin2011}, 
and the number of driver nodes in a network is determined mainly by the 
network's degree distribution, assuming linear dynamics at
individual nodes~\citep{Liu2011}.

\subsubsection{Shortest path and betweenness}
\label{sec:shortest_path}
\emph{Shortest paths} $d_{ij}$ from node $i$ to node $j$ play an important 
role in the transport and communication 
within a network. Although highly efficient algorithm exists to perform
route planning such as in Google Maps~\citep{Sanders2005}, common algorithms
for calculating shortest paths are Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted networks
and the breadth-first search for unweighted networks.

An extension of the shortest path is a measure of the importance of a given 
node defined by the sum of the fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass 
through it, or the 
\emph{betweenness} $b_i$ of a node $i$ is given by
\begin{equation}
b_i = \sum_{s,t \in N} \frac{\sigma(s,t|i)}{\sigma(s,t)},
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the set of nodes, $\sigma(s,t)$ is the number of shortest paths 
between node $s$ and $t$, and $\sigma(s,t|i)$ is the number of those paths 
passing through the node $i$ other than $s$ and $t$.

\subsubsection{Motif}
A \emph{network motif} $M$ is a pattern of interconnections occurring in complex 
networks at a number that is significantly higher than those in randomized 
networks~\citep{Milo2002,Shen-Orr2002}. The statistical significance of M is 
then described by the $Z$-score, defined as
\begin{equation}
Z_M = \frac{n_M - \langle n_M^{rand} \rangle}{\sigma_{n_M^{rand}}},
\end{equation}
where $n_M$ is the number of times the subgraph $M$ appears in $G$, and 
$\langle n_M^{rand} \rangle$ and $\sigma_{n_M^{rand}}$ are, respectively, 
the mean and 
standard deviation of the number of appearances in the randomized network ensemble.
Motifs have been strongly linked to the information processing in networks, 
for example, the incoherent feedforward loop was shown to be able to detect
fold change in the input signal~\citep{Goentoro2009}.

\subsubsection{Community}
A \emph{network community} or module is a subnetwork with many edges joining
nodes of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining nodes of 
different clusters. Since such communities can be considered as fairly 
independent compartments of a graph, they are usually also assigned 
a similar function, e. g., individual tissues or organs in the human body,
pathways within the cellular signal transduction network, a group of people
with common interest within the social network~%
\citep{Fortunato2010,Newman2012}.

There are now a zoo of algorithms to detect network communities, probably one
of the most influential methods is the algorithm proposed by \cite{Girvan2002},
which aims at the identification of edges lying between communities and their 
successive removal, a procedure that after some iterations
leads to the isolation of the communities. Most recently, \cite{Ahn2010b} 
suggested that each node in a network can in principle belong to more than 
one functional group, they therefore reinvented the definition of communities 
as groups of links rather than nodes and demonstrated this approach can uncover
natural overlap while revealing hierarchical organization of the network.

\subsection{Scale-free networks}
\label{sec:scale_free}
Together with the small-world network model, the scale-free network model~%
\citep{Barabasi1999} has
also attracted much attention in the research community. The basic idea of 
how a scale-free network and its power-law degree distribution comes into
existence is called preferential attachment. In other words, at each time
step of a growing network, a new node is added to a certain node in the 
network based on the probability that is proportional to the degree of the
given node, i.e. strongly connected nodes will get more and more connections,
popular nodes will be even more attractive. Such a model is able to reproduce
the power-law degree distribution observed in scale-free networks.

However, recent years have seen a critical assessment of the original 
scale-free model. On the one hand, several rigorous statistical analyses~%
\citep{Clauset2009,Khanin2006a} have shown that methods used to fit power-laws, such as 
least-squares, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of the 
parameters. The authors concluded that in general the cumulative distribution
function is more robust than the probability distribution function against 
fluctuations due to finite sample sizes, especially in the tail of the 
distribution. It is also extremely difficult to distinguish between
the log-normal and power-law distribution. These results cast doubt on the
validity of most empirical characterization of power-law degree distribution
and the significance of classifying scale-free networks according to such
degree distributions.

On the other hand, there is now increasing evidence that mechanisms other than
preferential attachment can also lead to the empirical power-law degree 
distribution~\citep{Caldarelli2002}. For instance, a model of unspecific 
binding between proteins results exactly in a scale-free protein-protein 
interaction network~\citep{Deeds2006}.

\section{Network dynamics}
Imagine the scene of fireworks, the beauty lies exactly in the whole sequence 
of explosive events. When you try to snap a shot, maybe you will end up with
a black sky. Even if you are able to capture the highlight, you still 
effectively miss certain information, such as how the visual pattern developed,
what is the interval between consecutive illuminations. 
On the other extreme, one also loses information when making
a long-exposure photograph out of the whole sequence.
The same holds in the
study of complex networks, if we want to understand the behavior of networks,
we always have to study their dynamics, rather than simply in a static context.

Here the network dynamics refers specifically to the dynamic response of the 
gene regulatory network. Such data are usually obtained from the microarray
time series. Microarray technology takes advantage of hybridization properties 
of nucleic acids and uses complementary molecules (probes) attached to a solid 
surface 
(chip) to measure the quantity of specific nucleic acid transcripts of 
interest that are present in a sample. A specialized scanner is used to 
measure the amount of hybridized target at each probe, which is reported as an 
intensity~\citep{Gentleman2005}. This intensity value is then interpreted as a
proxy for the level of gene expression. In order to characterize the global 
gene expression given a certain stimulus over time, one can perform the 
hybridization at multiple time points. The ultimate gene expression data are
thus multidimensional time series. 

In the following we provide two distinct 
perspectives of viewing the gene expression time series, namely ranking the 
single gene dynamics within the same experimental condition by multidimensional
scaling, and likelihood ratio test of kinetic profiles between two conditions
by fitting a linear model to the time series.

\subsection{Dimensionality reduction}
Dimensionality reduction is the transformation of high-dimensional data into 
a meaningful representation of reduced dimensionality~\citep{Maaten2009}, 
which is easy to both visualize and interpret. There are a whole spectrum of linear
and nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms 
(\ref{fig:dimension_reduction}). In this work, we heavily 
focus on a variant of Euclidean distance based multidimensional 
scaling (MDS), which is similar to principal component analysis (PCA)%
~\citep{Haerdle2003},
but more flexible and intuitive. We also evaluate the performance of MDS in comparison to 
PCA in the following.

techniques, taken from \cite{Maaten2009}.

\label{fig:dimension_reduction}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Multidimensional scaling}
\label{sec:mds}
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a family of algorithms that produces a spatial
representation of the dissimilarities between a number of entities $x_l^i \in 
\boldsymbol{X}_{n \times q}$ in $q$-dimensional space. In 
principle, MDS takes as input a symmetric $n \times n$ matrix 
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{D} = \sqrt{\sum_{l=1}^q (x_l^i - x_l^j)^2}_{\substack{i \neq j,\\
    i,j=1...n}},
\end{equation}
which
describes the dissimilarities between the high-dimensional
entities. Those entities
are then represented by points in a low-dimensional space $\hat{x}_l^i \in 
\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}_{n \times d}$ ($d$ usually equals $2$ or
$3$ for ease of visualization), which are positioned
such that the pairwise distances between them 
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\boldsymbol{D}} = \sqrt{\sum_{l=1}^d (\hat{x}_l^i - \hat{x}_l^j)^2}_{\substack{
    i \neq j,\\i,j=1...n}}
\end{equation}
reflect as closely as possible  
the original
dissimilarities between the entities. 
The optimization of the spatial configuration can be realized by the 
minimization of different stress functions.
We applied
here the HiT-MDS-2 algorithm (\citealp{Strickert2009}), where the
Pearson correlation of the original and the reconstructed distances 

\begin{equation}
  r(\boldsymbol{D}, \hat{\boldsymbol{D}}) = \frac{\sum_{i \neq j}^n (d_{ij} - \mu_{\boldsymbol{D}}
    ) \cdot (\hat{d}_{ij} - 
    \mu_{\hat{\boldsymbol{D}}})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i \neq j}^n (d_{ij} - \mu_{\boldsymbol{D}})^2} 
    \cdot \sqrt{
    \sum_{i \neq j}^n (\hat{d}_{ij} - \mu_{\hat{\boldsymbol{D}}})^2}}
  \label{eq:dist_corr}
\end{equation}
is defined as the negated stress function and is maximized using a gradient descent approach.
Particularly, $\boldsymbol{D} = (d_{ij})_{i,j=1...n}$ is Euclidean distance matrix of the
gene expression time series, and $\hat{\boldsymbol{D}} = (\hat{d}_{ij})_{i,j=1...n}$ 
is the 
Euclidean distance matrix of the reconstructed low-dimensional points. 
$\mu_{\boldsymbol{D}}$ and $\mu_{\hat{\boldsymbol{D}}}$ are the mean of matrix $\boldsymbol{D}$
and $\hat{\boldsymbol{D}}$ respectively.
\begin{eqnarray}
  \mu_{\boldsymbol{D}} = \frac{2}{n (n-1)} \sum_{i<j}^N d_{ij},\\
  \mu_{\hat{\boldsymbol{D}}} = \frac{2}{n (n-1)} \sum_{i<j}^N \hat{d}_{ij}.
\end{eqnarray}
%A stress function 
%\begin{equation}
%  s = -r(\boldsymbol{D}, \hat{\boldsymbol{D}})
%\end{equation}
%is minimized by gradient descent.
Throughout this work, the number of optimization cycles is fixed to be $100$.
Since any reflection or rotation of the low-dimensional point configuration
remains a valid solution of MDS,
we centered the final configuration, normalized it by the largest dimension variance,
and rotated it by Principal Component Analysis to generate a unique 
representation of the low-dimensional configuration.

\subsubsection{Performance of multidimensional scaling}
Taking the time-resolved gene expression profiles of hepatocyte growth factor
stimulated keratinocytes as an example, we projected the time series onto a 
two-dimensional space by different algorithms and assessed their performance
by calculating the correlation between the original and reconstructed distance
matrices (\ref{eq:dist_corr}).

While the correlation of distances by PCA (\ref{fig:svd-mds} A) is 0.89, two 
realizations of the HiT-MDS-2 algorithm show a correlation coefficient around 
0.98 (\ref{fig:svd-mds} C,D). Although this is slightly lower than the correlation of a recently 
proposed algorithm (\ref{fig:svd-mds} B), it clearly outperforms PCA. The 
better performance of the SVD-MDS algorithm~\citep{Becavin2011} results from
the fact that it initializes the spatial configuration with PCA instead of 
random guess, thus already starts from a relatively good solution of MDS and
avoids being stuck in local minima.

down-regulated genes with an average $\log_2$ fold expression 
$> 0.5$. }
\label{fig:svd-mds}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Response strength metric}
\label{sec:response_strength}
In order to quantify the response strength of a single gene, we make use of 
MDS, namely by fitting a skewed Gaussian distribution (\citealp{Azzalini2003}) 
to the 2-D projection
of gene expression time series and assigning a $p$-value to each
gene according to its probability of being drawn from the fitted distribution.
We further take the negative logarithmic of the $p$-values as the response
strength metric. In so doing, a gene located at the periphery of the MDS
projection has a small $p$-value and thus a large response strength, whereas
central genes have small response strengths.

A multivariate skewed Gaussian distribution is defined as follows, suppose
$X$ is a $d$-dimensional random variable with a probability density function
\begin{equation}
f(X) = 2 \phi_d (X;\Omega) \ \Phi(\alpha^{\mathrm{T}} X), \quad X \in \mathbb{R}^d,
\label{eq:sn}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_d(X;\Omega)$ is the $N_d(0,\Omega)$ normal density function at $X$
with the correlation matrix $\Omega$, $\Phi(\alpha^{\mathrm{T}} X)$ is the 
cumulative distribution function of $N(0,1)$ evaluated at $\alpha^{\mathrm{T}} X$.
$\alpha$ is the shape parameter since when $\alpha=0$, \ref{eq:sn} becomes
the regular normal probability density function again. $X$ can be further
linear transformed to
\[
Y = \xi + \omega X
\]
to include the location and scale parameter, $\xi$ and $\omega$ respectively.

Fitting of the skewed Gaussian distribution is performed with
the maximum likelihood method as implemented in the 
\texttt{R}
library \texttt{sn}.

\subsection{Heavy-tailed response distribution}
Based on the multidimensional scaling, we observe an 
invariant response pattern that only few genes are strongly 
induced upon stimulation, while the majority reacts
moderately (\ref{fig:response_strength}). 
For example, in the case of transcripts
profiled in primary human keratinocytes under the stimulation of 
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)~\citep{Busch2008}, we found the distribution of response
strengths has a long tail, indicating that 
only few genes are strongly induced by a certain stimulus, while the majority 
are barely regulated. This long-tail response strength
distribution is also observed in other cell types with various stimuli.
Among them are yeast cells that undergo cell cycles when synchronized by 
$\alpha$-factor~\citep{Spellman1998,Cho1998}, mouse skin cells stimulated with TPA~\citep{Riehl2010} and erythrocyte progenitor
(CFU-E) cells from the mouse fetal liver stimulated with erythropoietin (Epo)~\citep{Bachmann2011}. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{network/fig/response_all.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption[Heavy-tail distribution of gene response strength]{
{\bf Distribution of gene response strength in different
cell types under different stimulation.}
Gene response strengths are calculated as described in 
\ref{sec:response_strength}, the maximum of each distribution
is normalized to 1. Datasets used in this plot include 
primary human keratinocytes 
stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor (ArrayExpress database 
\texttt{http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/},
accession number E-TABM-440); CFU-E cells from mouse fetal livers stimulated
with Epo (GEO database \texttt{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/}, accession
number GSE26151); yeast cells synchronized with 
$\alpha$-factor to study the cell cycle
\\(\texttt{http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/data/rawdata/combined.txt}).
}
\label{fig:response_strength}
\end{figure}

The response distributions do not fit well with any of the 
Gaussian, power-law, exponential, log-normal or Weibull distribution, with the closet one being power-law or log-normal
distribution up to a certain range (\ref{fig:response_fit}). 
Nevertheless, the response distributions from various 
biological systems do share the same shape between each 
other (\ref{fig:response_qqplot}). Taken together, gene
responses are indeed heavy-tailed distributed, with few
genes strongly regulated and the majority only moderately
regulated, but they do not follow the power-law distribution,
which underlines again the necessity of assessing power-law
distribution on empirical data within a rigorous statistical
framework~\citep{Clauset2009}.

in each dataset is normalized to 1.
}
\label{fig:response_qqplot}
\end{figure}

The finding of the heavy-tailed response distribution provides a theoretical
proof of various microarray normalization schemes, since it is often assumed
that the majority of 
genes are not differentially regulated or the number of upregulated genes 
roughly equals the number of downregulated genes~\citep{Do2006}.
It is known that the structures of
regulatory networks in various species are highly conserved~\citep{Brown2007}, 
we thus hypothesize that this
universally invariant transcriptome response pattern results from the generic
topological features of the gene regulatory networks. Further questions 
arise, what distinguishes 
between the strongly and weakly responding genes? How is phenotype encoded 
in the gene network?


\section{Gene response and connectivity}
Through the simulation of a thermodynamical gene network model, we observed that the response strength of the gene network
is primarily determined by its topology. This topological
determinant is more dominant in large and scale-free-like 
networks, it is also 
visible in various biological data.

\subsection{Synthetic \emph{in silico} networks}
We first describe the construction of \emph{in silico}
network models, both in terms of topology and dynamics.

\subsubsection{Topology}
\begin{itemize}
\item Random: an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph (\citealp{Erdos1959}) is generated with a probability
  $0.003$ to choose each of the possible edges.
\item Uniform: network with uniform in- and out-degree distributions $k_{in,out} \in 
  \{0,1,...,11\}$ is constructed 
  with the configuration model (\citealp{Newman2001}). 
  In short, a configuration network 
  is constructed in the following manner. Each node $i$ has a desired degree $k_i$, 
  so we imagine that each node has $k_i$ edge ``stubs'' attached to it. Edges are 
  then assigned by randomly choosing two stubs and drawing an edge between them.
\item Small-world: a small-world graph with 1000 nodes 
according to the 
Watts-Strogatz model~\citep{Watts1998} is generated, 
each node is connected
to 5 nearest neighbors in the ring topology and each edge
has a rewiring probability of 0.1. In the end, the 
undirected small-world graph is converted to a directed
graph by randomly assigning edge directions.
\item Scale-free: similar to the case of uniform networks,
except that Poisson in-degree (with $\lambda = 3$) and power-law 
  out-degree distributions ($P(k) = k^{-2.5}$) are assumed as the input
  to the configuration model.
\item Bow-tie: two growing network (GN) graphs 
  (\citealp{Krapivsky2001}) of equal size are first 
  constructed by adding nodes one at a time with an edge to one existing node, 
  which results in two directed trees. With redirection probability $0.1$ the edge
  connects the additional node with the successor node of the random selected target
  node instead of the target node itself. One of the trees is then reversed and 
  concatenated to the other one through the root nodes, such that the resulting
  graph is of the multiple-input multiple-output type.
\end{itemize}
All networks have 1000 nodes and are generated with the Python package NetworkX 
(\citealp{Hagberg2008}), they are further made sure to be connected.

\subsubsection{Dynamics}
We adapted a thermodynamical gene network model 
(\citealp{Schilstra2002,Marbach2010,Schaffter2011}),
which takes into account the combinatorial control of transcription factors. 
Precisely, the 
gene expression dynamics is defined by 
\begin{equation}
  \dot{x_i}(t) = m_i \cdot f_i(x_j(t)) - d_i \cdot x_i(t), 
\label{eq:gnw_model}
\end{equation}
where $x_i(t)$ denotes the expression level of gene $i$ at time $t$, 
$m_i$ is the 
maximum transcription rate, $d_i$ the mRNA degradation rate. $f_i(\cdot)$
is the activation function of gene $i$, it depends on the expression level of 
all the input onto gene $i$ at time $t$, $x_j(t)$ and is the sum of relative 
activations for
different binding states. In general, for $N$ input genes, there are altogether
$2^N$ possible binding states and
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle f_i(x_j) = \sum_{m=0}^{2^N-1} \alpha_m \theta_m,
\end{equation}
$m$ can be interpreted as an $N$-digit binary number (with padding $0$s) 
and represents one perticular binding state, with the $i$-th
digit indicating the binding state of the $i$-th input gene, namely $0$ for unbound
and $1$ for bound. $\alpha_m$ is the relative activation of state $m$,
$\theta_m$ is the joint probability of state $m$: 
\begin{equation}
  \theta_{m} = \prod_j \frac{x_j^{n_{ij}}}{k_{ij}^{n_{ij}}+x_j^{n_{ij}}}
    \cdot \prod_k \frac{k_k^{n_{ik}}}{k_{ik}^{n_{ik}}+x_k^{n_{ik}}}
\end{equation}
where the probability of a single transcription factor bound to the gene is 
modelled by a Hill function,
$n$ is the Hill coefficient and $k$ is the dissociation constant, at which the
saturation is half-maximal or the transcription factor is bound $50\%$ of the time.
$x_j$ are the bound transcription factors of $x_i$ and $x_k$ the unbound ones.

Time series are simulated by first finding the steady state, where the absolute
concentration change is smaller than $10^{-5} + 10^{-3} \cdot x_i$ for each gene
or the maximal time of $500$ is exceeded. Afterwards, the basal activation $\alpha_0$
is randomly perturbed and the gene expression dynamics is simulated for a total
time of $200$ with $10$ as the time interval and the
steady state as the initial condition.

%\CC{} code of the model adapted from GeneNetWeaver (\citealp{Schaffter2011})
%is available upon request.

\subsubsection{Rewiring and change of parameters}
In order to compare the influence of both topology and model parameters on 
the network response, we changed the network topology by rewiring edges and 
the kinetic parameters $m_i, d_i$ (\ref{eq:gnw_model}) of a gene $i$ 
respectively (\ref{fig:rewiring_scheme}). The
network response strengths before and afterwards were then compared by
calculating the Pearson correlation. More specifically, in the case of 
rewiring, the list of target nodes is randomly permutated and assigned to the
source nodes to form new edges. 
In such a way, the total number of edges
remains the same after rewiring. 
Topology-related parameters $\alpha, k, n$ are
then regenerated, but kinetic parameters remain the same. 
When changing the model parameters of individual genes, we fixed the network
topology, but changed both the intrinsic response of individual genes and 
the connection strength by tuning the kinetic and topological parameters 
respectively.

connections and red edges with an arrow head represent activating

\subsection{Topology determines dynamics}
We investigate the influence of network topology on the immediate, dynamic gene response in networks. 
To first gain insight into the role that network topology plays, we compared
the different network responses after change of topology and change of model
parameters in an ensemble of \emph{E. coli} networks.
In the case of rewiring, we permutated the order of target nodes while keeping
the number of connections and kinetics parameters such as synthesis and 
degradation rates constant. Pearson correlation coefficients of the response
strengths before and after rewiring decrease slightly with the network size 
(\ref{fig:system_size}). 
In contrast, when we 
change the model parameters without affecting the network topology (%
\ref{fig:rewiring_scheme}), the Pearson correlation coefficients almost remains 
at the same level and 
are in general higher than that before and after rewiring. The Kullback-Leibler
divergence, which measures the distance between two distributions, further 
confirms that the distance between the effect of rewiring and parameter change 
increases with the network size, indicating that network topology has a stronger 
impact on the response pattern, especially in large networks.

\end{figure}

One has to keep in mind that when changing the parameters,
the connection strengths of individual edges are also varied,
and only the network connectivity remains the same. However,
parameter change has in general a higher correlation coefficient
and thus less effect than rewiring, which changes the connectivity.
This result highlights the importance of network topology in
determining the network dynamics, since rewiring decreases
the correlation of network response more strongly than 
parameter change, and this effect becomes more pronounced in
larger networks. Our conclusion is very much in line with a 
recent idea of \emph{geometry-controlled kinetics}~%
\citep{Benichou2010}, or the 
initial distance between reactants in compact systems is 
a key parameter and determinant of reaction kinetics, which 
could possibly be applied to the role that topology plays 
in gene regulatory networks.

The existence of topological determinant in network dynamics
further justifies the assumptions of chemical reaction network
theory (CRNT), that is for any networks following mass action kinetics,
a non-negative integer $\delta$ called the
deficiency can be derived from the network structure
alone and the number of steady states and the possibility of 
oscillation can be deduced from the deficiency value~\citep{Conradi2005}.

\subsection{Anti-correlation between dynamics and topology}
\label{sec:anti-correlation}
Previous studies~\citep{Lu2007a,Mar2011} have demonstrated a negative
correlation between the connectivity of a gene in the regulatory network
and its expression variance in the context of static disease models.
Here, we aim to address whether this negative correlation also exists 
between the network topology and its dynamic response.

To this end, we characterized the dynamic gene response strengths from 
various microarray studies of primary human keratinocytes, mouse skin
cells, mouse erythrocyte progenitor cells, \emph{E. coli}, yeast and
correlated them with the connectivity of
%\emph{in silico} 
%network models that are used to generate benchmark datasets for the DREAM 
%(Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenge. 
%The model (\citealp{Marbach2010}) describes gene expression dynamics by the 
%combinatorial regulation of upstream transcription factors. We constructed 
%\emph{in silico} network models (\ref{fig:degree_response_example}) with a predefined topology from 
transcriptional regulatory networks, for example for \emph{E. coli} 
(\citealp{Gama-Castro2008}) 
and \emph{S. cerevisiae} (\citealp{Balaji2006}). In the case of human and
mouse cells, no such comprehensive gene regulatory networks is available
and we thus took the protein-protein interaction network from BioGRID~%
\citep{Stark2006} as a first approximation. 
We further investigate the same correlation in a random,
uniform, small-world, scale-free or bow-tie network. Network dynamics was simulated after 
random 
multi-factorial perturbations from the steady state. Afterwards, the response 
strengths of individual genes are quantified by means of multidimensional 
scaling (\ref{sec:response_strength}). 
This workflow enables us to investigate how the dynamic
response pattern of a network relates to its topology.

\end{figure}

Our results demonstrated that genes in biological networks with a high level 
of change in expression are more likely to be peripheral nodes 
(low connectivity) in the network, whereas hubs (nodes with higher 
connectivity) and superhubs (nodes that link hubs) tend to have a lower level 
of change in expression. This anti-correlation is less pronounced in 
\emph{in silico} networks to different extents. By characterizing the 
anti-correlation using the center of mass for each point distribution, we
can show that scale-free\footnote{Although this result should be interpreted 
with caution according to \ref{sec:scale_free}.} and bow-tie networks are more closely related to
biological networks, whereas random, uniform and small-world networks behave
differently (\ref{fig:degree_response_summary}).

The fact that strongly regulated genes always have a low degree and thus are
located at the periphery of the network poses the question whether these genes
mediate the computation of the whole network and then translate it into the 
phenotype. We therefore took the transcriptome data from the literature,
where time-resolved response of \emph{E. coli} (\citealp{Jozefczuk2010}) and 
\emph{S. cerevisiae} (\citealp{Spellman1998,Cho1998}) is 
measured under different stimuli. We found a similar anti-correlation between
network topology and response in the above datasets (\ref{fig:ecoli_yeast_go} A,C). Furthermore, we
carried out enrichment test of Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the significantly 
strong responders identified from MDS. 
For \emph{E. coli} cells in response
to different stress conditions (\ref{fig:ecoli_yeast_go} D), GO terms such as 
locomotion, flagella organization
are over-represented in the strongly responding genes, which is in accordance
to the fact that flagella motility requires a steep proton gradient between 
the periplasmatic space and the cytoplasm, a change in cell motion could 
indicate energy deficiency resulting from the environmental stress~\citep{Jozefczuk2010}. 
On the other hand, for yeast cells in response to different synchronization
treatments (\ref{fig:ecoli_yeast_go} B), GO terms like cell cycle, cell division, cytokinesis are more 
enriched than expected among strong responders, which is also in line with the
phenotype of cell cycles. Taken together, we found strongly induced genes, 
which are located at the periphery of gene regulatory networks, are nicely
correlated with the cellular phenotype.

\label{fig:ecoli_yeast_go}
\end{figure}

Our results present an invariant feature of gene regulatory
networks, namely strongly responding genes correlate with
the phenotype and are sparsely connected peripheral nodes, 
in contrast, densely connected hub genes are only moderately
regulated. Further GO term analysis reveals that metabolic
function and transcriptional regulation are depleted in the
strong responders (\ref{fig:ecoli_yeast_go_under}).
This feature can be considered as an \emph{elephant in the room},
things that people tend to overlook although quite obvious
in the first place. People working with microarray data are
usually interested in a ranked list of genes, sometimes as the 
main research result, sometimes as a
preliminary step to more complex experimental validation~%
\citep{Boulesteix2009,Smyth2004}. On the one hand, different ranking
algorithms often lead to unreproducible lists; On the other
hand, if one only examines those top-ranked genes in more
details, one only focuses on the genes related to the phenotype,
or workhorses, and will thus not be able to detect master regulators
that determine the mechanism of action.

The finding of strongly regulated genes being sparsely connected
has also implication for the reverse engineering of gene regulatory
networks. Although sparsity has widely been assumed in the field
of reverse engineering~\citep{Yeung2002,Gardner2003}, especially
for solving linear ordinary differential equation models, it was
not explicitly stated whether this assumption holds. From what
we learned so far, if one starts to reconstruct the network consisting only of
differentially regulated genes, it is also highly likely that
the network is sparse.

\section{Biological application}
We further went on to verify our hypothesis that strongly regulated peripheral 
genes are correlated with the phenotype by means of an \emph{in vitro}
mammalian cell system, namely migration of primary human keratinocytes extracted from the foreskin
upon the treatment of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). 
This system is of particular interest to wound healing, which is a complex 
dynamic process involving a variety of players in the skin.
HGF activates its receptor MET, a proto-oncogene commonly mutated in 
metastasizing epithelial cell, and thus the cellular response to HGF is 
crucial for understanding the migration behavior or even wound healing and 
metastasis in general. 

We measured
the gene expression profiles in keratinocytes up to 8h after treatment of HGF (\citealp{Busch2008}) 
and identified
key genes with a large response strength according to MDS 
(\ref{fig:degree_response_hgf}). The gene list 
ranked by MDS-based response metric largely agrees with a previous list 
according to the ranking of peak and mean fold expression over time~%
\citep{Busch2008}. Among the top-ranked genes, PTGS2 is a prostaglandin 
synthase and a major mediator of inflammation; AKAP12 is a regulator 
of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, which could suppress HGF-induced 
migration; PLAUR encodes the plasminogen urokinase activator receptor;
CEACAM1 encodes a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is a
cell adhesion molecule in leukocytes, epithelial and endothelial cells.
The perturbation of all the above players can reduce the closed migration 
area~\citep{Busch2008,Schnickmann2009}.

{\bf Degree-response anti-correlation of gene regulation in HGF-stimulated
keratinocytes.}

}
\label{fig:degree_response_hgf}
\end{figure}

We further identified 3 genes that only pop up in the MDS-based ranking.
FERMT2 is also called kindlin 2 and participates in the connection between 
extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion sites and the actin cytoskeleton, the
colocalization of kindlin gene products is relevant for the pathophysiology
of the Kindler syndrome; Interleukin 8 is one of the major mediators
of the inflammatory response; PTGER4 is a receptor for prostaglandin E2.
The functions of these genes all point to the regulation of cell shape and
inflammation. 
To verify the role these genes play in keratinocyte migration,
we used either antibodies or siRNAs to perturb the products of these genes
(\ref{table:inhibition_method}). One example is shown in 
\ref{fig:scratch_assay}, where keratinocytes treated with HGF and IL8 
neutralizing antibodies were found to migrate slower within 12 hours 
than those only treated with HGF.
Indeed, the inhibition of FERMT2, IL8 and PTGER4 all have an effect on the 
migratory phenotype of keratinocytes (\ref{fig:migration_prediction}).

We provided a proof of principle that key genes with a high MDS-based response
score are correlated with the cellular phenotype, they fulfil their functions
while being located at the periphery of the network and sparsely connected.
The advantage of the MDS-based response metric is that it can rapidly generate
testable hypotheses from the multidimensional gene expression time series data.
