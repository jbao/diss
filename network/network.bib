	(YEASTRACT) information system (http://www.yeastract.com) was developed
	to support the analysis of transcription regulatory associations
	in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Last updated in June 2010, this database
	contains over 48,200 regulatory associations between transcription
	factors (TFs) and target genes, including 298 specific DNA-binding
	sites for 110 characterized TFs. All regulatory associations stored
	in the database were revisited and detailed information on the experimental
	evidences that sustain those associations was added and classified
	as direct or indirect evidences. The inclusion of this new data,
	gathered in response to the requests of YEASTRACT users, allows the
	user to restrict its queries to subsets of the data based on the
	existence or not of experimental evidences for the direct action
	of the TFs in the promoter region of their target genes. Another
	new feature of this release is the availability of all data through
	a machine readable web-service interface. Users are no longer restricted
	to the set of available queries made available through the existing
	web interface, and can use the web service interface to query, retrieve
	and exploit the YEASTRACT data using their own implementation of
	additional functionalities. The YEASTRACT information system is further
	complemented with several computational tools that facilitate the
	use of the curated data when answering a number of important biological
	questions. Since its first release in 2006, YEASTRACT has been extensively
	used by hundreds of researchers from all over the world. We expect
	that by making the new data and services available, the system will
	continue to be instrumental for yeast biologists and systems biology
	researchers.},

  abstract = {Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting
	objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological
	organisms and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure
	and dynamics of networks is to identify communities: groups of related
	nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes
	or social spheres. Communities in networks often overlap such that
	nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks
	are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities
	are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the
	fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap,
	where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the
	consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships
	between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups
	of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach
	successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of
	overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing
	literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities
	naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization.
	We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major
	biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic
	networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically
	organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales
	while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link
	communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and
	hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same
	phenomenon.},

	the initial distance between reactants in 'compact' systems-can become
	a key parameter. These findings could help explain the crucial role
	that the spatial organization of genes has in transcription kinetics,

  journal = {Bioinformatics},
  year = {2011},
  month = {Mar},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a well known multivariate
	statistical analysis method used for dimensionality reduction and
	visualization of similarities and dissimilarities in multidimensional
	data. The advantage of MDS with respect to Singular Value Decomposition
	(SVD) based methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
	its superior fidelity in representing the distance between different
	instances specially for high-dimensional geometric objects. Here
	we investigate the importance of the choice of initial conditions
	for MDS, and show that SVD is the best choice to initiate MDS. Furthermore,
	we demonstrate that the use of the first principal components of
	SVD to initiate the MDS algorithm is more efficient than an iteration
	through all the principal components. Adding stochasticity to the
	molecular dynamics simulations typically used for MDS of large datasets,
	contrary to previous suggestions, likewise does not increase accuracy.
	Finally, we introduce a k nearest neighbor method to analyze the
	local structure of the geometric objects and use it to control the
	quality of the dimensionality reduction. RESULTS: We demonstrate
	here the, to our knowledge, most efficient and accurate initialization
	strategy for MDS algorithms, reducing considerably computational
	load. SVD-based initialization renders MDS methodology much more
	useful in the analysis of high-dimensional data such as functional
	genomics datasets. CONTACT: arndt@ihes.fr.},

  year = {2006},
  volume = {360},
  pages = {213--227},
  number = {1},
  month = {Jun},
  abstract = {Studies on various model systems have shown that a relatively small
	number of transcription factors can set up strikingly complex spatial
	and temporal patterns of gene expression. This is achieved mainly
	by means of combinatorial or differential gene regulation, i.e. regulation
	of a gene by two or more transcription factors simultaneously or
	under different conditions. While a number of specific molecular
	details of the mechanisms of combinatorial regulation have emerged,
	our understanding of the general principles of combinatorial regulation
	on a genomic scale is still limited. In this work, we approach this
	problem by using the largest assembled transcriptional regulatory
	network for yeast. A specific network transformation procedure was
	used to obtain the co-regulatory network describing the set of all
	significant associations among transcription factors in regulating
	common target genes. Analysis of the global properties of the co-regulatory
	network suggested the presence of two classes of regulatory hubs:
	(i) those that make many co-regulatory associations, thus serving
	as integrators of disparate cellular processes; and (ii) those that
	make few co-regulatory associations, and thereby specifically regulate
	one or a few major cellular processes. Investigation of the local
	structure of the co-regulatory network revealed a significantly higher
	than expected modular organization, which might have emerged as a
	result of selection by functional constraints. These constraints
	probably emerge from the need for extensive modular backup and the
	requirement to integrate transcriptional inputs of multiple distinct
	functional systems. We then explored the transcriptional control
	of three major regulatory systems (ubiquitin signaling, protein kinase
	and transcriptional regulation systems) to understand specific aspects
	of their upstream control. As a result, we observed that ubiquitin
	E3 ligases are regulated primarily by unique transcription factors,
	whereas E1 and E2 enzymes share common transcription factors to a
	much greater extent. This suggested that the deployment of E3s unique
	to specific functional contexts may be mediated significantly at
	the transcriptional level. Likewise, we were able to uncover evidence
	for much higher upstream transcription control of transcription factors
	themselves, in comparison to components of other regulatory systems.
	We believe that the results presented here might provide a framework
	for testing the role of co-regulatory associations in eukaryotic
	transcriptional control.},

	between two nonhomogeneous time-series data sets. As increasing amounts
	of high-throughput biological data become available, a major challenge
	in genomic and computational biology is to develop methods for comparing
	data from different experimental sources. Time-series whole-genome
	expression data are a particularly valuable source of information
	because they can describe an unfolding biological process such as
	the cell cycle or immune response. However, comparisons of time-series
	expression data sets are hindered by biological and experimental
	inconsistencies such as differences in sampling rate, variations
	in the timing of biological processes, and the lack of repeats. Our
	algorithm overcomes these difficulties by using a continuous representation
	for time-series data and combining a noise model for individual samples
	with a global difference measure. We introduce a corresponding statistical
	method for computing the significance of this differential expression
	measure. We used our algorithm to compare cell-cycle-dependent gene
	expression in wild-type and knockout yeast strains. Our algorithm
	identified a set of 56 differentially expressed genes, and these
	results were validated by using independent protein-DNA-binding data.
	Unlike previous methods, our algorithm was also able to identify
	22 non-cell-cycle-regulated genes as differentially expressed. This
	set of genes is significantly correlated in a set of independent
	expression experiments, suggesting additional roles for the transcription
	factors Fkh1 and Fkh2 in controlling cellular activity in yeast.},

	systems have features of complex networks--such as small-world topology,
	highly connected hubs and modularity--both at the whole-brain scale
	of human neuroimaging and at a cellular scale in non-human animals.
	In this article, we review studies investigating complex brain networks
	in diverse experimental modalities (including structural and functional
	MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography
	in humans) and provide an accessible introduction to the basic principles
	of graph theory. We also highlight some of the technical challenges

	initiate and maintain migration. Context information for enhancing,
	delaying or stopping migration is provided by the activity of the

	a "scale-free" topology, for which the probability of observing a
	node with a certain number of edges (k) follows a power law: i.e.,
	p(k) approximately k(-gamma). This observation has been reproduced
	by evolutionary models. Here we consider the network of protein-protein
	interactions (PPIs) and demonstrate that two published independent
	measurements of these interactions produce graphs that are only weakly
	correlated with one another despite their strikingly similar topology.
	We then propose a physical model based on the fundamental principle
	that (de)solvation is a major physical factor in PPIs. This model
	reproduces not only the scale-free nature of such graphs but also
	a number of higher-order correlations in these networks. A key support
	of the model is provided by the discovery of a significant correlation
	between the number of interactions made by a protein and the fraction
	of hydrophobic residues on its surface. The model presented in this
	paper represents a physical model for experimentally determined PPIs
	that comprehensively reproduces the topological features of interaction
	networks. These results have profound implications for understanding
	not only PPIs but also other types of scale-free networks.},

  abstract = {A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties
	of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web.
	Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that
	seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law
	degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article,
	we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the
	property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined
	together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser
	connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities,
	built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community
	boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world
	graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the
	method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability.
	We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure
	is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find
	that it detects significant and informative community divisions in
	both cases.},

	to find molecular mechanisms of gene regulation that can provide
	such fold-change detection. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that
	fold-change detection can be generated by one of the most common
	network motifs in transcription networks, the incoherent feedforward
	loop (I1-FFL), in which an activator regulates both a gene and a
	repressor of the gene. The fold-change detection feature of the I1-FFL
	applies to the entire shape of the response, including its amplitude
	and duration, and is valid for a wide range of biochemical parameters.},

	by rapid decrease of central carbon metabolism intermediates coinciding
	with downregulation of genes related to cell growth. Application
	of co-clustering and canonical correlation analysis on combined metabolite

	to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of
	biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. The book drives to the
	heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance
	of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept
	of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order that is
	widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self-organization
	plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection.
	Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the
	concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction
	requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood,
	as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able
	to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows
	how complex systems, contrary to expectations, can spontaneously
	exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is
	essential for understanding the emergence and development of life
	on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular
	evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs
	and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many
	naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive
	power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues.
	Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new

	These growing networks are built by adding nodes successively, and

	of nodes with k links, N(k)(t), decays faster than a power law in

	emerges which connects to nearly all other nodes. When A(k) is asymptotically

	combined age and degree distribution of nodes shows that old nodes

	are more likely to be connected. The size distributions of the in

	analyzed the topological characteristics of the modulated genes.
	Fourth, we analyzed the correlation between the topology and biological
	function using the Gene Ontology classifications. Our results demonstrate
	that nodes with high connectivity (hubs and superhubs) tend to have
	low levels of change in gene expression. The significance of our

  abstract = {Gene expression analysis has become a ubiquitous tool for studying
	a wide range of human diseases. In a typical analysis we compare
	distinct phenotypic groups and attempt to identify genes that are,
	on average, significantly different between them. Here we describe
	an innovative approach to the analysis of gene expression data, one
	that identifies differences in expression variance between groups
	as an informative metric of the group phenotype. We find that genes
	with different expression variance profiles are not randomly distributed
	across cell signaling networks. Genes with low-expression variance,
	or higher constraint, are significantly more connected to other network
	members and tend to function as core members of signal transduction
	pathways. Genes with higher expression variance have fewer network
	connections and also tend to sit on the periphery of the cell. Using
	neural stem cells derived from patients suffering from Schizophrenia
	(SZ), Parkinson's disease (PD), and a healthy control group, we find
	marked differences in expression variance in cell signaling pathways
	that shed new light on potential mechanisms associated with these
	diverse neurological disorders. In particular, we find that expression
	variance of core networks in the SZ patient group was considerably
	constrained, while in contrast the PD patient group demonstrated
	much greater variance than expected. One hypothesis is that diminished
	variance in SZ patients corresponds to an increased degree of constraint
	in these pathways and a corresponding reduction in robustness of
	the stem cell networks. These results underscore the role that variation
	plays in biological systems and suggest that analysis of expression
	variance is far more important in disease than previously recognized.
	Furthermore, modeling patterns of variability in gene expression
	could fundamentally alter the way in which we think about how cellular
	networks are affected by disease processes.},

	inflammatory response have been studied intensively. However, corresponding
	mechanisms that sustain the expression of inflammatory response genes
	and hence contribute to the establishment of chronic disorders remain
	poorly understood. Recently, we provided genetic evidence that signaling
	via the receptor for advanced glycation end products (Rage) drives
	the strength and maintenance of an inflammatory reaction. In order
	to decipher the mode of Rage function on gene transcription levels
	during inflammation, we applied global gene expression profiling
	on time-resolved samples of mouse back skin, which had been treated
	with the phorbol ester TPA, a potent inducer of skin inflammation.Ranking
	of TPA-regulated genes according to their time average mean and peak
	expression and superimposition of data sets from wild-type (wt) and
	Rage-deficient mice revealed that Rage signaling is not essential
	for initial changes in TPA-induced transcription, but absolutely
	required for sustained alterations in transcript levels. Next, we
	used a data set of differentially expressed genes between TPA-treated
	wt and Rage-deficient skin and performed computational analysis of
	their proximal promoter regions. We found a highly significant enrichment
	for several transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) leading to
	the prediction that corresponding transcription factors, such as
	Sp1, Tcfap2, E2f, Myc and Egr, are regulated by Rage signaling. Accordingly,
	we could confirm aberrant expression and regulation of members of
	the E2f protein family in epidermal keratinocytes of Rage-deficient
	mice.In summary, our data support the model that engagement of Rage
	converts a transient cellular stimulation into sustained cellular
	dysfunction and highlight a novel role of the Rb-E2f pathway in Rage-dependent

  pages = {8},
  abstract = {Neuronal network models often assume a fixed probability of connection
	between neurons. This assumption leads to random networks with binomial
	in-degree and out-degree distributions which are relatively narrow.
	Here I study the effect of broad degree distributions on network
	dynamics by interpolating between a binomial and a truncated power-law
	distribution for the in-degree and out-degree independently. This
	is done both for an inhibitory network (I network) as well as for
	the recurrent excitatory connections in a network of excitatory and
	inhibitory neurons (EI network). In both cases increasing the width
	of the in-degree distribution affects the global state of the network
	by driving transitions between asynchronous behavior and oscillations.
	This effect is reproduced in a simplified rate model which includes
	the heterogeneity in neuronal input due to the in-degree of cells.
	On the other hand, broadening the out-degree distribution is shown
	to increase the fraction of common inputs to pairs of neurons. This
	leads to increases in the amplitude of the cross-correlation (CC)
	of synaptic currents. In the case of the I network, despite strong
	oscillatory CCs in the currents, CCs of the membrane potential are
	low due to filtering and reset effects, leading to very weak CCs
	of the spike-count. In the asynchronous regime of the EI network,
	broadening the out-degree increases the amplitude of CCs in the recurrent
	excitatory currents, while CC of the total current is essentially
	unaffected as are pairwise spiking correlations. This is due to a
	dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents.
	In the oscillatory regime, changes in the out-degree can have a large
	effect on spiking correlations and even on the qualitative dynamical
	state of the network.},

	networks that control gene expression in cells. Recent advances in
	data collection and analysis, however, are generating unprecedented
	amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand
	these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks
	into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely
	used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network
	motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different
	parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in
	randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically
	detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation
	networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia
	coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances
	of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific
	function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal
	expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external
	signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable
	view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism.
	This approach may help define the basic computational elements of
	other biological networks.},

  abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed
	microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002)
	derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression
	in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical
	parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical
	model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for
	general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments
	and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear
	models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The
	approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color
	microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived
	for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have
	robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete
	data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior
	odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic
	in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place
	of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is
	equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards
	a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the
	number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has
	the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters
	which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the
	non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated
	t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees
	of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate
	tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics.
	The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study.

	that require extensive mining and refining to extract useful information.
	We demonstrate the usefulness of (non-metric) multidimensional scaling
	(MDS) method in analyzing a large number of genes. Applying MDS to
	the microarray data is certainly not new, but the existing works
	are all on small numbers (< 100) of points to be analyzed. We have
	been developing an efficient novel algorithm for non-metric MDS (nMDS)
	analysis for very large data sets as a maximally unsupervised data
	mining device. We wish to demonstrate its usefulness in the context
	of bioinformatics (unraveling relational patterns among genes from
	time series data in this paper). RESULTS: The Pearson correlation
	coefficient with its sign flipped is used to measure the dissimilarity
	of the gene activities in transcriptional response of cell-cycle-synchronized
	human fibroblasts to serum. These dissimilarity data have been analyzed
	with our nMDS algorithm to produce an almost circular relational
	pattern of the genes. The obtained pattern expresses a temporal order
	in the data in this example; the temporal expression pattern of the
	genes rotates along this circular arrangement and is related to the
	cell cycle. For the data we analyze in this paper we observe the
	following. If an appropriate preparation procedure is applied to
	the original data set, linear methods such as the principal component
	analysis (PCA) could achieve reasonable results, but without data
	preprocessing linear methods such as PCA cannot achieve a useful
	picture. Furthermore, even with an appropriate data preprocessing,
	the outcomes of linear procedures are not as clear-cut as those by
	nMDS without preprocessing.},

  title = {Multidimensional scaling for large genomic data sets.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {179},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) is aimed to represent
	high dimensional data in a low dimensional space with preservation
	of the similarities between data points. This reduction in dimensionality
	is crucial for analyzing and revealing the genuine structure hidden
	in the data. For noisy data, dimension reduction can effectively
	reduce the effect of noise on the embedded structure. For large data
	set, dimension reduction can effectively reduce information retrieval
	complexity. Thus, MDS techniques are used in many applications of
	data mining and gene network research. However, although there have
	been a number of studies that applied MDS techniques to genomics
	research, the number of analyzed data points was restricted by the
	high computational complexity of MDS. In general, a non-metric MDS
	method is faster than a metric MDS, but it does not preserve the
	true relationships. The computational complexity of most metric MDS
	methods is over O(N2), so that it is difficult to process a data
	set of a large number of genes N, such as in the case of whole genome
	microarray data. RESULTS: We developed a new rapid metric MDS method
	with a low computational complexity, making metric MDS applicable
	for large data sets. Computer simulation showed that the new method
	of split-and-combine MDS (SC-MDS) is fast, accurate and efficient.
	Our empirical studies using microarray data on the yeast cell cycle
	showed that the performance of K-means in the reduced dimensional
	space is similar to or slightly better than that of K-means in the
	original space, but about three times faster to obtain the clustering
	results. Our clustering results using SC-MDS are more stable than
	those in the original space. Hence, the proposed SC-MDS is useful
	for analyzing whole genome data. CONCLUSION: Our new method reduces
	the computational complexity from O(N3) to O(N) when the dimension
	of the feature space is far less than the number of genes N, and
	it successfully reconstructs the low dimensional representation as
	does the classical MDS. Its performance depends on the grouping method
	and the minimal number of the intersection points between groups.
	Feasible methods for grouping methods are suggested; each group must
	contain both neighboring and far apart data points. Our method can
	represent high dimensional large data set in a low dimensional space
	not only efficiently but also effectively.},

	responses identified by their positions in the array. In a second
	approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation
	domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening
	procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins,
	expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the
	library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These
	approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions
	involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins. These data reveal interactions
	that place functionally unclassified proteins in a biological context,
	interactions between proteins involved in the same biological function,
	and interactions that link biological functions together into larger
	cellular processes. The results of these screens are shown here.},

  abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological
	oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks,
	spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing
	systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either
	completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological
	and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here
	we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this
	middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing
	amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered,
	like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths,
	like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy
	with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of
	separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans,
	the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration
	graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models
	of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation
	speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular,
	infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than
	in regular lattices.},

	Caenorhabditis elegans has been deduced from reconstructions of electron
	micrographs of serial sections. The hermaphrodite nervous system

	invariant structure. Neurons with similar morphologies and connectivities
	have been grouped together into classes; there are 118 such classes.
	Neurons have simple morphologies with few, if any, branches. Processes
	from neurons run in defined positions within bundles of parallel
	processes, synaptic connections being made en passant. Process bundles
	are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent
	to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected,
	making synaptic connections with many of their neighbours. Muscle
	cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron
	axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions
	along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside.
	Most of the morphologically identifiable synaptic connections in
	a typical animal are described. These consist of about 5000 chemical
	synapses, 2000 neuromuscular junctions and 600 gap junctions.},

  abstract = {Several of the most ambitious theories in ecology describe food webs
	that document the structure of strong and weak trophic links that
	is responsible for ecological dynamics among diverse assemblages

	have little omnivory and several properties that are independent
	of species richness. This theory was overturned by empirical studies
	that found food webs to be much more complex, but these studies did
	not provide mechanistic explanations for the complexity. Here we
	show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by
	successfully predicting key structural properties of the most complex
	and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties
	include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic
	levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability
	and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory,
	looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters,
	species number and connectance, our 'niche model' extends the existing
	'cascade model and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species
	to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic
	niche.},

  journal = {Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A},
  year = {2010},
  month = {May},
  abstract = {The genome has often been called the operating system (OS) for a living
	organism. A computer OS is described by a regulatory control network
	termed the call graph, which is analogous to the transcriptional
	regulatory network in a cell. To apply our firsthand knowledge of
	the architecture of software systems to understand cellular design
	principles, we present a comparison between the transcriptional regulatory
	network of a well-studied bacterium (Escherichia coli) and the call
	graph of a canonical OS (Linux) in terms of topology and evolution.
	We show that both networks have a fundamentally hierarchical layout,
	but there is a key difference: The transcriptional regulatory network
	possesses a few global regulators at the top and many targets at
	the bottom; conversely, the call graph has many regulators controlling
	a small set of generic functions. This top-heavy organization leads
	to highly overlapping functional modules in the call graph, in contrast
	to the relatively independent modules in the regulatory network.
	We further develop a way to measure evolutionary rates comparably
	between the two networks and explain this difference in terms of
	network evolution. The process of biological evolution via random
	mutation and subsequent selection tightly constrains the evolution
	of regulatory network hubs. The call graph, however, exhibits rapid
	evolution of its highly connected generic components, made possible
	by designers' continual fine-tuning. These findings stem from the
	design principles of the two systems: robustness for biological systems
	and cost effectiveness (reuse) for software systems.},
