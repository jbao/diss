  abstract = {Summary Metastasis and chemoresistance in cancer are linked phenomena,
	but the molecular basis for this link is unknown. We uncovered a
	network of paracrine signals between carcinoma, myeloid, and endothelial
	cells that drives both processes in breast cancer. Cancer cells that
	overexpress CXCL1 and 2 by transcriptional hyperactivation or 4q21
	amplification are primed for survival in metastatic sites. CXCL1/2
	attract CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells into the tumor, which produce chemokines
	including S100A8/9 that enhance cancer cell survival. Although chemotherapeutic
	agents kill cancer cells, these treatments trigger a parallel stromal
	reaction leading to TNF-Œ± production by endothelial and other stromal
	cells. TNF-Œ± via NF-kB heightens the CXCL1/2 expression in cancer
	cells, thus amplifying the CXCL1/2-S100A8/9 loop and causing chemoresistance.
	CXCR2 blockers break this cycle, augmenting the efficacy of chemotherapy
	against breast tumors and particularly against metastasis. This network
	of endothelial-carcinoma-myeloid signaling interactions provides
	a mechanism linking chemoresistance and metastasis, with opportunities
	for intervention.},

	initiate and maintain migration. Context information for enhancing,

  pages = {279--290},
  number = {2},

  abstract = {Cells respond to environmental perturbations with changes in their
	gene expression that are coordinated in magnitude and time. Timing
	information about individual genes, rather than clusters, provides
	a refined way to view and analyze responses, but it is hard to estimate
	accurately. To analyze response timing of individual genes, we developed
	a parametric model that captures the typical temporal responses:
	an abrupt early response followed by a second transition to a steady
	state. This impulse model explicitly represents natural temporal
	properties such as the onset and the offset time, and can be estimated
	robustly, as demonstrated by its superior ability to impute missing
	values in gene expression data. Using response time of individual
	genes, we identify relations between gene function and their response
	timing, showing, for example, how cytosolic ribosomal genes are only
	repressed after the mitochondrial ribosome is activated. We further
	demonstrate a strong relation between the binding affinity of a transcription
	factor and the activation timing of its targets, suggesting that
	graded binding affinities could be a widely used mechanism for controlling
	expression timing. See online Supplementary Material at (www.liebertonline.com).},

  title = {{Statistical issues in the analysis of Illumina data.}},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {85},
  abstract = {Illumina bead-based arrays are becoming increasingly popular due to
	their high degree of replication and reported high data quality.
	However, little attention has been paid to the pre-processing of
	Illumina data. In this paper, we present our experience of analysing
	the raw data from an Illumina spike-in experiment and offer guidelines
	for those wishing to analyse expression data or develop new methodologies
	for this technology.We find that the local background estimated by
	Illumina is consistently low, and subtracting this background is
	beneficial for detecting differential expression (DE). Illumina's
	summary method performs well at removing outliers, producing estimates
	which are less biased and are less variable than other robust summary
	methods. However, quality assessment on summarised data may miss
	spatial artefacts present in the raw data. Also, we find that the
	background normalisation method used in Illumina's proprietary software
	(BeadStudio) can cause problems with a standard DE analysis. We demonstrate
	that variances calculated from the raw data can be used as inverse
	weights in the DE analysis to improve power. Finally, variability
	in both expression levels and DE statistics can be attributed to
	differences in probe composition. These differences are not accounted
	for by current analysis methods and require further investigation.Analysing
	Illumina expression data using BeadStudio is reasonable because of
	the conservative estimates of summary values produced by the software.
	Improvements can however be made by not using background normalisation.
	Access to the raw data allows for a more detailed quality assessment
	and flexible analyses. In the case of a gene expression study, data
	can be analysed on an appropriate scale using established tools.
	Similar improvements can be expected for other Illumina assays.},

	enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30203, a randomized phase
	II study of eicosanoid modulation in addition to chemotherapy in
	patients with advanced NSCLC, to determine whether these levels had

	serum was collected from patients enrolled in CALGB 30203. Serum
	VEGF levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
	methodology. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the

	survival. Pretreatment formalin fixed tissue was stained for 5-LOX

	was 502 pg/ml (range, 55-3453 pg/ml). Dichotomized serum VEGF levels
	at median inversely correlated with survival time (p = 0.008), as
	did VEGF levels as a continuous variable in multivariate analysis
	(p = 0.035). VEGF levels were significantly correlated neither with
	baseline COX-2 expression (Pearson r = 0.1524, p = 0.271) nor with
	5-LOX expression. Treatment with COX-2 or 5-LOX inhibitors did not
	alter the levels.These data indicate that elevated serum VEGF is
	a negative prognostic variable in NSCLC. VEGF levels are neither
	correlated with baseline tumor COX-2 expression nor do they respond

	Endothelial cells (ECs) are also ubiquitous within tumors because

	less well understood. Through paracrine regulation, ECs modulate
	a diverse spectrum of pathophysiologic processes in normal and hyperplastic
	tissues. We hypothesized that ECs offer similar paracrine regulatory
	control of cancer biology. Indeed, secretions from quiescent ECs
	muted the proliferative and invasive phenotype of lung and breast
	cancer cells in vitro and reduced cancer cell protumorigenic and
	proinflammatory signaling. EC perlecan silencing significantly changed
	this regulatory relationship, eliminating the ability of ECs to inhibit
	cancer cell invasiveness via increased interleukin-6 secretion. Moreover,
	implanting ECs embedded within porous matrices slowed adjacent xenograft
	tumor growth and prevented architectural degeneration, with a concomitant
	reduction in proliferative and tumorigenic markers. Finally, lung
	carcinoma cells pretreated with intact EC-conditioned media, but
	not media conditioned with perlecan-silenced ECs, exhibited reduced
	micrometastatic burden after tail vein injection. These findings
	add to an emerging appreciation of EC-regulatory effects that transcend

	264.7 macrophages as a model cellular system, we demonstrate that
	treatment of CT26 cells with RAW 264.7 conditioned medium induces
	cell migration, invasion and metastasis. Inflammatory gene microarray
	analysis indicated CT26-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages upregulate
	SDF-1alpha and VEGF, and that these cytokines contribute to CT26
	migration in vitro. RAW 264.7 macrophages also showed a robust chemotactic
	response towards CT26-derived chemokines. In particular, microarray
	analysis and functional testing revealed CSF-1 as the major chemoattractant
	for RAW 264.7 macrophages. Interestingly, in the chick CAM model
	of cancer progression, RAW 264.7 macrophages localized specifically
	to the tumor periphery where they were found to increase CT26 tumor
	growth, microvascular density, vascular disruption, and lung metastasis,
	suggesting these cells home to actively invading areas of the tumor,
	but not the hypoxic core of the tumor mass. In support of these findings,
	hypoxic conditions down regulated CSF-1 production in several tumor
	cell lines and decreased RAW 264.7 macrophage migration in vitro.
	Together our findings suggest a model where normoxic tumor cells
	release CSF-1 to recruit macrophages to the tumor periphery where
	they secrete motility and angiogenic factors that facilitate tumor
	cell invasion and metastasis.},

	the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability

  abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer cells express the chemokine receptor, CXCR4,
	which may be associated with increased survival and metastatic potential,
	but the regulation of this receptor is not understood. The inflammatory
	cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is found in ovarian
	cancer biopsies and is associated with increased tumor grade. In
	this report, we show that CXCR4 expression on human epithelial ovarian
	cancer cells is associated with, and can be modulated by, TNF-alpha.
	Ovarian cancer cells with high endogenous expression of TNF-alpha
	expressed higher levels of CXCR4 mRNA and protein than cells with
	low TNF-alpha expression. Stimulation of ovarian cancer cell lines
	and primary epithelial cancer cells with TNF-alpha resulted in increased
	CXCR4 mRNA and protein. The TNF-alpha-stimulated increase in CXCR4
	mRNA was due partly to de novo synthesis, and up-regulation of CXCR4
	cell surface protein increased migration to the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12.
	CXCR4 mRNA and protein was down-regulated by anti-TNF-alpha antibody
	or by targeting TNF-alpha mRNA using RNAi. TNF-alpha stimulation
	activated components of the nuclear factor kappaB pathway, and overexpression
	of the inhibitor of kappaB also reduced CXCR4 expression. Coculture
	of macrophages with ovarian cancer cells also resulted in cancer
	cell up-regulation of CXCR4 mRNA in a TNF-alpha-dependent manner.
	Finally, there was a correlation between the levels of TNF-alpha
	and CXCR4 mRNA in clinical biopsies of ovarian cancer, and TNF-alpha
	protein was expressed in CXCR4-positive tumor cells. TNF-alpha is
	a critical mediator of tumor promotion in a number of experimental
	cancers. Our data suggest that one mechanism may be through nuclear
	factor kappaB-dependent induction of CXCR4.},

  abstract = {Gene set analysis (GSA) is a widely used strategy for gene expression
	data analysis based on pathway knowledge. GSA focuses on sets of
	related genes and has established major advantages over individual
	gene analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological
	relevance. However, previous GSA methods have limited usage as they
	cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental
	designs.To address these limitations, we present a new GSA method
	called Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE). We successfully
	apply GAGE to multiple microarray datasets with different sample
	sizes, experimental designs and profiling techniques. GAGE shows
	significantly better results when compared to two other commonly
	used GSA methods of GSEA and PAGE. We demonstrate this improvement
	in the following three aspects: (1) consistency across repeated studies/experiments;
	(2) sensitivity and specificity; (3) biological relevance of the
	regulatory mechanisms inferred.GAGE reveals novel and relevant regulatory
	mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished microarray
	studies. From two published lung cancer data sets, GAGE derived a
	more cohesive and predictive mechanistic scheme underlying lung cancer
	progress and metastasis. For a previously unpublished BMP6 study,
	GAGE predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for BMP6 induced osteoblast
	differentiation, including the canonical BMP-TGF beta signaling,
	JAK-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathways-all
	of which are supported by the experimental literature.GAGE is generally
	applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes
	and experimental designs. GAGE consistently outperformed two most
	frequently used GSA methods and inferred statistically and biologically
	more relevant regulatory pathways. The GAGE method is implemented
	in R in the "gage" package, available under the GNU GPL from http://sysbio.engin.umich.edu/~luow/downloads.php.},

	to be Gaussian; and biologic variability (noise) among tumors, of
	which we propose three types.Our analysis of the TCGA data demonstrates
	a contributory role for technical factors in molecular classification
	inconsistencies in glioblastoma but also suggests that biological
	variability, abnormal data distribution, and non-linear relationships
	among genes may be responsible for a proportionally larger component
	of classification error. These findings may have important implications
	for both glioblastoma research and for translational application

  abstract = {Invasive and metastatic potentials of several types of carcinoma cells
	are regulated through interactions with host stromal cells, e.g.,
	tumor-stromal interactions. Because hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
	a ligand for the c-Met proto-oncogene product, is a mesenchymal-
	or stromal-derived factor that induces mitogenic, motogenic, and
	morphogenic responses, we examined the mechanisms involved in tumor-stromal
	interactions in vitro. The c-Met/HGF receptor was expressed in A431
	human epidermoid carcinoma cells, A549 human non-small cell lung
	cancer cells, HuCC-T1 human cholangiocellular carcinoma cells, and
	SBC-3 human small cell lung carcinoma cells. HGF stimulated cell
	growth, scattering, and invasion of these cells. Although these cells
	did not produce biologically significant levels of HGF, these cells
	did secrete soluble factors that potently stimulated HGF production
	in human skin fibroblasts. These carcinoma cell-derived HGF inducers
	proved to be interleukin-1 (IL-1) in A431 cells, IL-1 plus basic
	fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in A549 and HuCC-T1 cells, and bFGF
	plus platelet-derived growth factor in SBC-3 cells. When these carcinoma
	cells were cocultured with fibroblasts, HGF levels in the coculture
	system were much higher than the levels in fibroblasts alone, without
	cocultured carcinoma cells. Together with the increase in HGF levels,
	the number of invasive cells increased, but in vitro invasion of
	carcinoma cells in the coculture system was strongly inhibited by
	anti-HGF antibodies. Thus, there are mutual interactions between
	carcinoma cells and fibroblasts: IL-1, bFGF, and platelet-derived
	growth factor derived from tumor cells play a role in inducing HGF
	expression in stromal fibroblasts, whereas fibroblast-derived HGF,
	in turn, leads to invasive growth in carcinoma cells. The mutual
	interactions, as mediated by HGF and HGF inducers, may play a significant
	role in the occurrence of invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells.},

	IL-1beta gene into mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells and subsequently
	inoculated the transformant (LLC/IL-1beta) to syngeneic C57BL/6 mice.
	Tumors derived from LLC/IL-1beta grew faster (240\%, day 18, vs null-vector
	control LLC/neo; p < 0.01) and showed more abundant vasculature (250\%,
	vs LLC/neo; p < 0.05), whereas LLC/IL-1beta cells, LLC/neo cells,
	and wild-type LLC cells did not show any significant difference in
	the growth rate in vitro. As compared with LLC/neo cells, LLC/IL-1beta
	cells secreted 2-fold the amount of vascular endothelial growth factor
	and >10-fold the amount of macrophage-inflammatory protein-2 (CXCL2),
	one of whose main functions is angiogenesis. Although LLC/IL-1beta
	itself did not secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the tumor

	larger amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor and macrophage-inflammatory
	protein-2. The antiangiogenic agent TNP-470 and anti-CXCR2 Ab inhibited
	the tumor growth of LLC/IL-1beta cells in vivo. These results indicated

	signaling promotes ischemia-induced angiogenesis via modulation of
	several angiogenic growth factors. We hypothesized that TNFR2/p75

	lung carcinoma (LLC1) and/or mouse melanoma B16 cell was evaluated
	in wild type (WT), p75 knockout (KO) and double p55KO/p75KO mouse
	tumor xenograft models. Compared with WT and p55KO/p75KO mice, growth
	of tumors in p75KO mice was significantly decreased (twofold) in
	both LLC and B16 tumors. Tumor growth inhibition was correlated with
	decreases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression
	and capillary density, as well as bone marrow-derived endothelial
	progenitor cells incorporation into the functional capillary network,
	and an increase in apoptotic cells in LLC xenografts. Gene array
	analysis of tumor tissues showed a decrease in gene expression in

	of particular interest because COX-2 expression was markedly augmented
	in both cell types (cancer cells and fibroblasts) in response to
	coculture. Coculture with fibroblasts also induced COX-2 expression
	in additional pancreatic cancer cells with an unmethylated COX-2
	promoter, but not in those with a methylated COX-2 promoter. Using
	an in vitro invasion assay, we found an increase in the invasive

	odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic
	in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place
	of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is
	equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards
	a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the
	number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has
	the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters
	which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the
	non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated
	t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees
	of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate
	tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics.
	The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study.
	Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

  abstract = {Drug resistance presents a challenge to the treatment of cancer patients.
	Many studies have focused on cell-autonomous mechanisms of drug resistance.
	By contrast, we proposed that the tumour micro-environment confers
	innate resistance to therapy. Here we developed a co-culture system
	to systematically assay the ability of 23 stromal cell types to influence
	the innate resistance of 45 cancer cell lines to 35 anticancer drugs.
	We found that stroma-mediated resistance is common, particularly
	to targeted agents. We characterized further the stroma-mediated
	resistance of BRAF-mutant melanoma to RAF inhibitors because most
	patients with this type of cancer show some degree of innate resistance.
	Proteomic analysis showed that stromal cell secretion of hepatocyte
	growth factor (HGF) resulted in activation of the HGF receptor MET,
	reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
	kinase (PI(3)K)-AKT signalling pathways, and immediate resistance
	to RAF inhibition. Immunohistochemistry experiments confirmed stromal
	cell expression of HGF in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma and
	showed a significant correlation between HGF expression by stromal
	cells and innate resistance to RAF inhibitor treatment. Dual inhibition
	of RAF and either HGF or MET resulted in reversal of drug resistance,
	suggesting RAF plus HGF or MET inhibitory combination therapy as
	a potential therapeutic strategy for BRAF-mutant melanoma. A similar
	resistance mechanism was uncovered in a subset of BRAF-mutant colorectal
	and glioblastoma cell lines. More generally, this study indicates
	that the systematic dissection of interactions between tumours and
	their micro-environment can uncover important mechanisms underlying
	drug resistance.},

	cultured with fibroblasts. The presence of hepatocyte growth factor
	(HGF) in conditioned medium from these fibroblasts correlated with
	resistance. Moreover, the proportion of HGF+ melanoma-associated

	BRAF inhibitors than non-HGF+ samples of human BRAF-V600E melanoma.
	The inhibition of HGF or MET (the HGF receptor, which was also activated

	indicating that paracrine HGF–MET signalling mediates this innate
	resistance. Both the MEK–ERK and PI3K–AKT pathways were activated
	when BRAF-V600E melanoma cells were treated with HGF; other ligands
	activated either ERK or AKT, but these did not abrogate drug sensitivity,
	indicating that both pathways need to be activated to confer resistance.
	Finally, the authors found evidence of autocrine HGF–MET signalling

	BRAF and MET inhibition had synergistic effects in two such cell

  abstract = {Cellular signal transduction is a complex process involving protein-protein
	interactions (PPIs) that transmit information. For example, signals
	from the plasma membrane may be transduced to transcription factors
	to regulate gene expression. To obtain a global view of cellular
	signaling and to predict potential signal modulators, we searched
	for protein interaction partners of more than 450 signaling-related
	proteins by means of automated yeast two-hybrid interaction mating.
	The resulting PPI network connected 1126 proteins through 2626 PPIs.
	After expansion of this interaction map with publicly available PPI
	data, we generated a directed network resembling the signal transduction
	flow between proteins with a naïve Bayesian classifier. We exploited
	information on the shortest PPI paths from membrane receptors to
	transcription factors to predict input and output relationships between
	interacting proteins. Integration of directed PPI with time-resolved
	protein phosphorylation data revealed network structures that dynamically
	conveyed information from the activated epidermal growth factor and
	extracellular signal-regulated kinase (EGF/ERK) signaling cascade
	to directly associated proteins and more distant proteins in the
	network. From the model network, we predicted 18 previously unknown
	modulators of EGF/ERK signaling, which we validated in mammalian
	cell-based assays. This generic experimental and computational approach
	provides a framework for elucidating causal connections between signaling
	proteins and facilitates the identification of proteins that modulate
