  abstract = {We briefly describe the toolkit used for studying complex systems:
	nonlinear dynamics, statistical physics, and network theory. We place
	particular emphasis on network theory--the topic of this special
	issue--and its importance in augmenting the framework for the quantitative
	study of complex systems. In order to illustrate the main issues,
	we briefly review several areas where network theory has led to significant
	developments in our understanding of complex systems. Specifically,
	we discuss changes, arising from network theory, in our understanding
	of (i) the Internet and other communication networks, (ii) the structure
	of natural ecosystems, (iii) the spread of diseases and information,
	(iv) the structure of cellular signalling networks, and (v) infrastructure
	robustness. Finally, we discuss how complexity requires both new
	tools and an augmentation of the conceptual framework--including
	an expanded definition of what is meant by a "quantitative prediction."},

	a nonlinear stochastic model, maximum likelihood parameter estimation,

	protein-protein interactions in our initial protein interaction networks
	by use of microarray data. Comparisons of the networks of apoptosis
	in HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells and in normal primary lung
	fibroblasts provided insight into the mechanism of apoptosis and
	allowed identification of potential drug targets. The potential targets
	include BCL2, caspase-3 and TP53. Our comparison of cancerous and
	normal cells also allowed derivation of several party hubs and date
	hubs in the human protein-protein interaction networks involved in

	expression profiles to identify markers correlated with metastasis.
	Here, we apply a protein-network-based approach that identifies markers
	not as individual genes but as subnetworks extracted from protein
	interaction databases. The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses
	for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known
	breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis
	of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein
	network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We
	find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual
	marker genes selected without network information, and that they
	achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus
	non-metastatic tumors.},

  abstract = {In cellular signal transduction, the information in an external stimulus
	is encoded in temporal patterns in the activities of signaling molecules;
	for example, pulses of a stimulus may produce an increasing response
	or may produce pulsatile responses in the signaling molecules. Here,
	we show how the Akt pathway, which is involved in cell growth, specifically
	transmits temporal information contained in upstream signals to downstream
	effectors. We modeled the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent
	Akt pathway in PC12 cells on the basis of experimental results. We
	obtained counterintuitive results indicating that the sizes of the
	peak amplitudes of receptor and downstream effector phosphorylation
	were decoupled; weak, sustained EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation,
	rather than strong, transient phosphorylation, strongly induced phosphorylation
	of the ribosomal protein S6, a molecule downstream of Akt. Using
	frequency response analysis, we found that a three-component Akt
	pathway exhibited the property of a low-pass filter and that this
	property could explain decoupling of the peak amplitudes of receptor
	phosphorylation and that of downstream effectors. Furthermore, we
	found that lapatinib, an EGFR inhibitor used as an anticancer drug,
	converted strong, transient Akt phosphorylation into weak, sustained
	Akt phosphorylation, and, because of the low-pass filter characteristics
	of the Akt pathway, this led to stronger S6 phosphorylation than
	occurred in the absence of the inhibitor. Thus, an EGFR inhibitor
	can potentially act as a downstream activator of some effectors.},

	a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately

	such as oscillations in the activity of key components [1-6], but
	it is often unclear whether such dynamic complexity is actually important
	for the network's regulatory functions [7, 8]. Here, we found that
	the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Fus3, a key regulator
	of the yeast mating-pheromone response, undergoes sustained oscillations
	in its phosphorylation and activation state during continuous pheromone
	exposure. These MAPK activity oscillations led to corresponding oscillations
	in mating-gene expression. Oscillations in MAPK activity and gene
	expression required the negative regulator of G protein signaling
	Sst2 and partially required the MAPK phosphatase Msg5. Peaks in Fus3
	activation correlated with periodic rounds of cell morphogenesis,
	with each peak preceding the formation of an additional mating projection.
	Preventing projection formation did not eliminate MAPK oscillation,
	but preventing MAPK oscillation blocked the formation of additional
	projections. A mathematical model was developed that reproduced several
	features of the observed oscillatory dynamics. These observations
	demonstrate a role for MAPK activity oscillation in driving a periodic
	downstream response and explain how the pheromone signaling pathway,
	previously thought to desensitize after 1-3 hr, controls morphology
	changes that continue for a much longer time.},

  abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well-characterized
	oncogene that is frequently activated by somatic kinase domain mutations
	in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR TKIs are effective therapies
	for NSCLC patients whose tumors harbor an EGFR activating mutation.
	However, EGFR TKI treatment is not curative in patients because of
	both primary and secondary treatment resistance. Studies over the
	last decade have identified mechanisms that drive primary and secondary
	resistance to EGFR TKI treatment. The elucidation of mechanisms of
	resistance to EGFR TKI treatment provides a basis for the development
	of therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance and enhance outcomes
	in NSCLC patients. In this paper, we summarize the mechanisms of
	resistance to EGFR TKIs that have been identified to date and discusses
	potential therapeutic strategies to overcome EGFR TKI resistance

	Edgetic perturbations seem to confer distinct functional consequences
