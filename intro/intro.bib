  abstract = {The advancements in "omics" (proteomics, genomics, lipidomics, and
	metabolomics) technologies have yielded large inventories of genes,
	transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. The challenge is to find
	out how these entities work together to regulate the processes by
	which cells respond to external and internal signals. Mathematical
	and computational modeling of signaling networks has a key role in
	this task, and network analysis provides insights into biological
	systems and has applications for medicine. Here, we review experimental
	and theoretical progress and future challenges toward this goal.
	We focus on how networks are reconstructed from data, how these networks
	are structured to control the flow of biological information, and
	how the design features of the networks specify biological decisions.},

  abstract = {Cell signaling mechanisms often transmit information via posttranslational
	protein modifications, most importantly reversible protein phosphorylation.
	Here we develop and apply a general mass spectrometric technology
	for identification and quantitation of phosphorylation sites as a
	function of stimulus, time, and subcellular location. We have detected
	6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined
	their temporal dynamics after stimulating HeLa cells with epidermal
	growth factor (EGF) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen
	percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by
	EGF, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly,
	a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing
	different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating
	signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible
	phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange
	factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators. The
	dynamic phosphoproteome provides a missing link in a global, integrative
	view of cellular regulation.},

  abstract = {To elucidate cellular events underlying the pluripotency of human
	embryonic stem cells (hESCs), we performed parallel quantitative
	proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of hESCs during differentiation
	initiated by a diacylglycerol analog or transfer to media that had
	not been conditioned by feeder cells. We profiled 6521 proteins and
	23,522 phosphorylation sites, of which almost 50\% displayed dynamic
	changes in phosphorylation status during 24 hours of differentiation.
	These data are a resource for studies of the events associated with
	the maintenance of hESC pluripotency and those accompanying their
	differentiation. From these data, we identified a core hESC phosphoproteome
	of sites with similar robust changes in response to the two distinct
	treatments. These sites exhibited distinct dynamic phosphorylation
	patterns, which were linked to known or predicted kinases on the
	basis of the matching sequence motif. In addition to identifying
	previously unknown phosphorylation sites on factors associated with
	differentiation, such as kinases and transcription factors, we observed
	dynamic phosphorylation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). We found
	a specific interaction of DNMTs during early differentiation with
	the PAF1 (polymerase-associated factor 1) transcriptional elongation
	complex, which binds to promoters of the pluripotency and known DNMT
	target genes encoding OCT4 and NANOG, thereby providing a possible
	molecular link for the silencing of these genes during differentiation.},

  abstract = {Protein function is often modulated by protein-protein interactions
	(PPIs) and therefore defining the partners of a protein helps to
	understand its activity. PPIs can be detected through different experimental
	approaches and are collected in several expert curated databases.
	These databases are used by researchers interested in examining detailed
	information on particular proteins. In many analyses the reliability
	of the characterization of the interactions becomes important and
	it might be necessary to select sets of PPIs of different confidence
	levels. To this goal, we generated HIPPIE (Human Integrated Protein-Protein
	Interaction rEference), a human PPI dataset with a normalized scoring
	scheme that integrates multiple experimental PPI datasets. HIPPIE's
	scoring scheme has been optimized by human experts and a computer
	algorithm to reflect the amount and quality of evidence for a given
	PPI and we show that these scores correlate to the quality of the
	experimental characterization. The HIPPIE web tool (available at
	http://cbdm.mdc-berlin.de/tools/hippie) allows researchers to do
	network analyses focused on likely true PPI sets by generating subnetworks
	around proteins of interest at a specified confidence level.},

  abstract = {An essential prerequisite for any systems-level understanding of cellular
	functions is to correctly uncover and annotate all functional interactions
	among proteins in the cell. Toward this goal, remarkable progress
	has been made in recent years, both in terms of experimental measurements
	and computational prediction techniques. However, public efforts
	to collect and present protein interaction information have struggled
	to keep up with the pace of interaction discovery, partly because
	protein-protein interaction information can be error-prone and require
	considerable effort to annotate. Here, we present an update on the
	online database resource Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting
	Genes (STRING); it provides uniquely comprehensive coverage and ease
	of access to both experimental as well as predicted interaction information.
	Interactions in STRING are provided with a confidence score, and
	accessory information such as protein domains and 3D structures is
	made available, all within a stable and consistent identifier space.
	New features in STRING include an interactive network viewer that
	can cluster networks on demand, updated on-screen previews of structural
	information including homology models, extensive data updates and
	strongly improved connectivity and integration with third-party resources.
	Version 9.0 of STRING covers more than 1100 completely sequenced
	organisms; the resource can be reached at http://string-db.org.},
