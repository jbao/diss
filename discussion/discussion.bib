	to assist in understanding the functioning of a system, to simulate

	the model can be directly obtained from experiments or from the literature.
	Others have to be inferred by comparing model results to experiments.
	In this minireview, we discuss the identifiability of models, both
	intrinsic to the model and taking into account the available data.
	Furthermore, we give an overview of the most frequently used approaches

  abstract = {<p>Network inference deals with the reconstruction of biological networks
	from experimental data. A variety of different reverse engineering
	techniques are available; they differ in the underlying assumptions
	and mathematical models used. One common problem for all approaches
	stems from the complexity of the task, due to the combinatorial explosion
	of different network topologies for increasing network size. To handle
	this problem, constraints are frequently used, for example on the
	node degree, number of edges, or constraints on regulation functions
	between network components. We propose to exploit topological considerations
	in the inference of gene regulatory networks. Such systems are often
	controlled by a small number of hub genes, while most other genes
	have only limited influence on the network's dynamic. We model gene
	regulation using a Bayesian network with discrete, Boolean nodes.
	A hierarchical prior is employed to identify hub genes. The first
	layer of the prior is used to regularize weights on edges emanating
	from one specific node. A second prior on hyperparameters controls
	the magnitude of the former regularization for different nodes. The
	net effect is that central nodes tend to form in reconstructed networks.
	Network reconstruction is then performed by maximization of or sampling
	from the posterior distribution. We evaluate our approach on simulated
	and real experimental data, indicating that we can reconstruct main
	regulatory interactions from the data. We furthermore compare our
	approach to other state-of-the art methods, showing superior performance
	in identifying hubs. Using a large publicly available dataset of
	over 800 cell cycle regulated genes, we are able to identify several
	main hub genes. Our method may thus provide a valuable tool to identify
	interesting candidate genes for further study. Furthermore, the approach
	presented may stimulate further developments in regularization methods
	for network reconstruction from data.</p>},

  abstract = {The regulatory interactions between transcription factors and their

	the presence of regulatory hubs. At a local level, substructures
	such as motifs and modules can be discerned in these networks. Despite
	the general organisational similarity of networks across the phylogenetic
	spectrum, there are interesting qualitative differences among the
	network components, such as the transcription factors. Although the
	DNA-binding domains of the transcription factors encoded by a given
	organism are drawn from a small set of ancient conserved superfamilies,
	their relative abundance often shows dramatic variation among different
	phylogenetic groups. Large portions of these networks appear to have
	evolved through extensive duplication of transcription factors and
	targets, often with inheritance of regulatory interactions from the
	ancestral gene. Interactions are conserved to varying degrees among
	genomes. Insights from the structure and evolution of these networks
	can be translated into predictions and used for engineering of the

  title = {A survey of {DNA} motif finding algorithms.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8 Suppl 7},
  pages = {S21},
  abstract = {Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major
	challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify
	regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic
	acid (DNA) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short
	DNA segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence
	availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies
	have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif
	finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms
	have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the
	past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in DNA motif
	finding algorithms.Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated
	genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented
	motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting
	or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter
	sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are
	used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly
	detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory
	experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel
	motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been
	shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but
	perform significantly worse in higher organisms.Despite considerable
	efforts to date, DNA motif finding remains a complex challenge for
	biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different
	approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made
	in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison
	of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools
	have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based
	on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our
	incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does
	not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over
	motif models.},

  number = {7},
  abstract = {Determining the regulation of metabolic networks at genome scale is
	a hard task. It has been hypothesized that biochemical pathways and
	metabolic networks might have undergone an evolutionary process of
	optimization with respect to several criteria over time. In this
	contribution, a multi-criteria approach has been used to optimize
	parameters for the allosteric regulation of enzymes in a model of
	a metabolic substrate-cycle. This has been carried out by calculating
	the Pareto set of optimal solutions according to two objectives:
	the proper direction of flux in a metabolic cycle and the energetic
	cost of applying the set of parameters. Different Pareto fronts have
	been calculated for eight different "environments" (specific time
	courses of end product concentrations). For each resulting front
	the so-called knee point is identified, which can be considered a
	preferred trade-off solution. Interestingly, the optimal control
	parameters corresponding to each of these points also lead to optimal
	behaviour in all the other environments. By calculating the average
	of the different parameter sets for the knee solutions more frequently
	found, a final and optimal consensus set of parameters can be obtained,
	which is an indication on the existence of a universal regulation
	mechanism for this system.The implications from such a universal
	regulatory switch are discussed in the framework of large metabolic

  abstract = {It is commonly assumed that somatic evolution drives the multi-step
	process that produces metastatic cancer. But it is difficult to reconcile
	the inexorable progression towards metastasis in virtually all carcinomas

	by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, with the random nature
	of gene mutations. Given their irreversible nature, it is also difficult
	to explain why certain metastatic carcinomas can reform normal tissue
	boundaries and remain dormant for years at distant sites. Here we
	propose an encompassing conceptual framework based on system-level
	dynamics of gene regulatory networks that may help reconcile these
	inconsistencies. The concepts of gene expression state space and
	attractors are introduced which provide a mathematical and molecular
	basis for an "epigenetic landscape". We then describe how cancer
	cells are trapped in "embryonic attractors" because of distortions
	of this landscape caused by mutational rewiring of the regulatory
	network. The implications of this concept for a new integrative understanding
	of tumor formation and metastatic progression are discussed. This
	formal framework of cancer progression unites mainstream genetic
	determinism with alternative ideas that emphasize non-genetic influences,

	alteration of cell mechanics and disruption of tissue architecture.},

	TFs in the yeast regulatory network into three hierarchical layers
	(top, core, and bottom) and integrating diverse genome-scale datasets,
	we find that the TFs have static and dynamic properties that are
	similar within a layer and different across layers. At the protein
	level, the top-layer TFs are relatively abundant, long-lived, and
	noisy compared with the core- and bottom-layer TFs. Although variability
	in expression of top-layer TFs might confer a selective advantage,
	as this permits at least some members in a clonal cell population
	to initiate a response to changing conditions, tight regulation of
	the core- and bottom-layer TFs may minimize noise propagation and
	ensure fidelity in regulation. We propose that the interplay between
	network organization and TF dynamics could permit differential utilization
	of the same underlying network by distinct members of a clonal cell

	gene regulatory networks based on different training data. Within
	the DREAM4 initiative, we took part in the multifactorial sub-challenge
	that aimed to predict gene regulatory networks of size 100 from training
	data consisting of steady-state levels obtained after applying multifactorial
	perturbations to the original in silico network. Due to the static
	character of the challenge data, we tackled the problem via a sparse
	Gaussian Markov Random Field, which relates network topology with
	the covariance inverse generated by the gene measurements. As for
	the computations, we used the Graphical Lasso algorithm which provided
	a large range of candidate network topologies. The main task was
	to select the optimal network topology and for that, different model
	selection criteria were explored. The selected networks were compared
	with the golden standards and the results ranked using the scoring
	metrics applied in the challenge, giving a better insight in our
	submission and the way to improve it.Our approach provides an easy
	statistical and computational framework to infer gene regulatory
	networks that is suitable for large networks, even if the number
	of the observations (perturbations) is greater than the number of
	variables (genes).},

  abstract = {Cell fate decision remarkably generates specific cell differentiation
	path among the multiple possibilities that can arise through the
	complex interplay of high-dimensional genome activities. The coordinated
	action of thousands of genes to switch cell fate decision has indicated
	the existence of stable attractors guiding the process. However,
	origins of the intracellular mechanisms that create "cellular attractor"
	still remain unknown. Here, we examined the collective behavior of
	genome-wide expressions for neutrophil differentiation through two
	different stimuli, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and all-trans-retinoic
	acid (atRA). To overcome the difficulties of dealing with single
	gene expression noises, we grouped genes into ensembles and analyzed
	their expression dynamics in correlation space defined by Pearson
	correlation and mutual information. The standard deviation of correlation
	distributions of gene ensembles reduces when the ensemble size is
	increased following the inverse square root law, for both ensembles
	chosen randomly from whole genome and ranked according to expression
	variances across time. Choosing the ensemble size of 200 genes, we
	show the two probability distributions of correlations of randomly
	selected genes for atRA and DMSO responses overlapped after 48 hours,
	defining the neutrophil attractor. Next, tracking the ranked ensembles'
	trajectories, we noticed that only certain, not all, fall into the
	attractor in a fractal-like manner. The removal of these genome elements
	from the whole genomes, for both atRA and DMSO responses, destroys
	the attractor providing evidence for the existence of specific genome
	elements (named "genome vehicle") responsible for the neutrophil
	attractor. Notably, within the genome vehicles, genes with low or
	moderate expression changes, which are often considered noisy and
	insignificant, are essential components for the creation of the neutrophil
	attractor. Further investigations along with our findings might provide
	a comprehensive mechanistic view of cell fate decision.},
