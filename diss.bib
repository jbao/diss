  abstract = {Reconstructing gene regulatory networks from high-throughput data
	is a long-standing challenge. Through the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering
	Assessment and Methods (DREAM) project, we performed a comprehensive
	blind assessment of over 30 network inference methods on Escherichia
	coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in silico
	microarray data. We characterize the performance, data requirements
	and inherent biases of different inference approaches, and we provide
	guidelines for algorithm application and development. We observed
	that no single inference method performs optimally across all data
	sets. In contrast, integration of predictions from multiple inference
	methods shows robust and high performance across diverse data sets.
	We thereby constructed high-confidence networks for E. coli and S.
	aureus, each comprising ∼1,700 transcriptional interactions at a
	precision of ∼50\%. We experimentally tested 53 previously unobserved
	regulatory interactions in E. coli, of which 23 (43\%) were supported.
	Our results establish community-based methods as a powerful and robust
	tool for the inference of transcriptional gene regulatory networks.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) are essential regulators of gene expression,
	and mutated TF genes have been shown to cause numerous human genetic
	diseases. Yet to date, no single, comprehensive database of human
	TFs exists. In this work, we describe the collection of an essentially
	complete set of TF genes from one depiction of the human ORFeome,
	and the design of a microarray to interrogate their expression. Taking
	1468 known TFs from TRANSFAC, InterPro, and FlyBase, we used this
	seed set to search the ScriptSure human transcriptome database for
	additional genes. ScriptSure's genome-anchored transcript clusters
	allowed us to work with a nonredundant high-quality representation
	of the human transcriptome. We used a high-stringency similarity
	search by using BLASTN, and a protein motif search of the human ORFeome
	by using hidden Markov models of DNA-binding domains known to occur
	exclusively or primarily in TFs. Four hundred ninety-four additional
	TF genes were identified in the overlap between the two searches,
	bringing our estimate of the total number of human TFs to 1962. Zinc
	finger genes are by far the most abundant family (762 members), followed
	by homeobox (199 members) and basic helix-loop-helix genes (117 members).
	We designed a microarray of 50-mer oligonucleotide probes targeted
	to a unique region of the coding sequence of each gene. We have successfully
	used this microarray to interrogate TF gene expression in species
	as diverse as chickens and mice, as well as in humans.},
